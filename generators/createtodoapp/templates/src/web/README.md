# Getting Started with Create React App and Fluent UI

This is a [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) based repo that comes with Fluent UI pre-installed!

## Setup

Create a `.env` file within the base of the `reactd-fluent` folder with the following configuration:

- `VITE_API_BASE_URL` - Base URL for all api requests, (ex: `http://localhost:3100`)

> Note: The URL must include the schema, either `http://` or `https://`.

- `VITE_APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` - Azure Application Insights connection string

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm ci`

Installs local pre-requisites.

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
